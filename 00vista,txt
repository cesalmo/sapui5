<Button text="Press Me" press=".doSomething"/> --> controller.doSomething()

Examples for such metadataContexts are:

{/Customers/Name} a single part with an absolute path to the property Name of the Customers entity set in the default model
{path: 'Customers/Name', model:'json'} a single part with an absolute path to the property Name of the Customers entity set in a named model
{parts: [{path: 'Customers/Name'},{path: 'editable', model: 'viewModel'}]} a combination of single binding contexts, one context from the default model and one from the viewModel
